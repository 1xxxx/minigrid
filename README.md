# Minigrid

Minimal 2kb zero dependency cascading grid layout.

Cascading grid without pain.

Website & Documentation: [http://alves.im/minigrid](http://alves.im/minigrid/).

## When to use?

Minigrid won't solve all problems. It was done having in mind "cards" with same width and different heights. It won't work if your grid item has different width sizes.

If you need more control I'd recommend [Isotope](http://isotope.metafizzy.co).
